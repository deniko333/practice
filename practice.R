# steps for pushing and pulling

# 1; save the file -> find the file name on the right, thick the square and commit
# give a description to the commit otherwise it won't work
#push the commited file 
# 2;if conflict message, first pull then type in the console git config pull.rebase false
# resolve the conflict (only leave the code you want to appear in the final version
# delete the dahs lines and head and that long number thing)
# 3; thick the file name again in the right (blue square U U) and commit the changes
# 4; push the changes and check results on git (might have to refresh)
